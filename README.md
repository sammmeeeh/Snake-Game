Snake Game 🐍
A classic Snake game implementation in C featuring dynamic memory management, linked list data structures, and collision detection mechanics.
Overview:
This project is a console-based Snake game developed as part of my Business Intelligence coursework at IHEC. It demonstrates proficiency in C programming, data structures, and game logic implementation.
Features:

Dynamic Snake Growth: Snake grows in size when consuming fruits
Collision Detection: Detects collisions with walls, fruits, and self
Random Obstacle Generation: Walls and fruits spawn at random positions
Wrap-around Movement: Snake wraps to the opposite side when crossing borders
Score Tracking: Real-time score updates based on fruits consumed
Special Fruits: Two types of fruits with different point values
      * Normal fruit
      $ Special fruit


Menu System: Interactive game menu with replay option

Technologies Used 🛠️ :

Language: C
Data Structures:

Linked Lists (for snake body segments)
2D Arrays (for game grid)


Memory Management: Dynamic memory allocation with malloc()
Concepts Applied:

Pointers and dynamic memory
Modular programming
Game loop architecture
